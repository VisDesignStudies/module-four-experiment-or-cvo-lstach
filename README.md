In this repository we have attached:
* The 24 visualizations that were created using R and D3/HTML
* The code to create the R and D3 visualizations
* The responses to our survey as an Excel sheet
* The final writeup as a PDF

Here are the surveys that we used to collect data:
* [Survey 1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLj7vNVGYHM3ZabBW3G-SjvDWOQeCXbBREpkGSR3CvVqKErA/viewform?fbzx=-7915634690915610099)
* [Survey 2](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEll8lS0SdfEFpTTCbWuC33J-omPhLezifmsThtYEf6DNZuw/viewform)
* [Survey 3](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfO5QkBBPycYm6Dmwu_tAgtYOdhyXK-twHnUEEnsidmhM3jCA/viewform?usp=sf_link)


The ``UsedCars.csv`` dataset used to make some of the R visualizations was too large to upload to GitHub, so it is available for reference via Google Drive [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lgmtNXZ4v3w6-ThGQLW8KLwvbWbt82da/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103166337416251255583&rtpof=true&sd=true).
